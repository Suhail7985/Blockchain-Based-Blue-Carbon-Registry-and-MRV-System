**Result**: ✅ Trustworthy, verifiable data that cannot be altered

### Solution 2: Tokenized Carbon Credits
**Problem**: Credits not tradeable, no financial incentive  
**Solution**: Create digital tokens (ERC-20) for carbon credits  
**Result**: ✅ Easy trading, financial incentive for restoration

### Solution 3: Integrated Data Collection
**Problem**: Manual, slow, error-prone data collection  
**Solution**: Mobile app + drone integration for automated data collection  
**Result**: ✅ Fast, accurate, real-time data collection

### Solution 4: Multi-Stakeholder Platform
**Problem**: Fragmented efforts, no collaboration  
**Solution**: Unified platform for NGOs, communities, panchayats  
**Result**: ✅ Coordinated restoration efforts

### Solution 5: Complete MRV System
**Problem**: No monitoring, reporting, verification  
**Solution**: Automated MRV system with blockchain verification  
**Result**: ✅ Real-time monitoring, automated verification
